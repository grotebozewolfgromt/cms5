past search history (of YouTube and Google),
emails in your Gmail account
the contents of your documents on Google Docs
your past website visits with Google Chrome (desktop and mobile)
The notes you took, texts you send (and everything else you did) on your Android phone, including photos you took, your GPS location and all the contacts (including phone numbers) in your Android phone
Everything you did with your Chrome book
The Google ads you clicked on a website or YouTube
The websites that you visited that had Google Analytics or Google ads in-stalled
And every other Google service you use, which I forgot to mention here
