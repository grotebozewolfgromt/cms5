Which
YouTube Impressions Click Through Rate would you rather have? 4
or 10?
10,
right?
Because
when
10
viewers
out
of 100 click, results
in more views
than when
4
people out of a 100 click.



Click
Through Rates (or
Impression-Click-Through-Rates, commonly
abbreviated as CTR) is
one of the key metrics that the YouTube algorithm looks at to
determine whether it should promote your video or not.
However,
Click Through Rates are misleading and
comparing them is next to impossible. Because
CTR doesn't tell what
you think it does.



A
higher Click Through Rate doesn’t always equal more views.
In
the example above:
Video
	1: 10 CTR: 7K views
	Video
	2: 4 CTR: 330K views.




What is the meaning of Impressions
Click Through Rate (CTR) on YouTube?
Click
Through Rate (or
CTR)
is the percentage of viewers that see your title and thumbnail and
click on it.
The
CTR is expressed in a percentage.



Click
Through Rate is a broad marketing term and not exclusively used in
the context of YouTube.
Also
for online advertisements and links in marketing emails are Click
Through Rates measured.



YouTube
uses Click Through Rates combined with Average View Duration, Average
Percentage Viewed and returning-viewers as the
most important
metrics to
promote a video in the algorithms like Suggested, Home and Search.



Why
is CTR not reliable?
Besides
the above mentioned metrics, there are more metrics that
YouTube looks at: like/dislike ratio, time on watch page, amount of
comments and probably 100 other factors that YouTube won’t reveal.



Herein
lies also the problem for using CTR as a reliable metric.
Click
Through Rate is only one
factor for the algorithm to consider whether it promotes your video
or not.
